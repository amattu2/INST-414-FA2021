# Introduction
This repository serves to keep track of assignments required of students during the INST 414 Fall 2021 semester. All assignments/projects/etc passed onto students will be completed here. This repository should not be confused with [INST-414](https://github.com/amattu2/INST-414), which was for tracking projects during which I was a student.
